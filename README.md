# OLYMPIC_HISTORY_DATA_ANALYSIS (1896 - 2016)
You can download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
In this , we shall practice writing SQL Queries on a real dataset. We shall download the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle from the user rgriffin.
This way instead of using cooked up data, we shall use real data to write our SQL Queries.
By having real data, it will be much easier for us to understand the data and then relate to it and write different types of queries over it.
